# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION
# Fake News Detection

Fake news can have a significant impact on public opinion and societal trust. This project leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect fake news articles, helping to flag misleading content. The notebook walks you through data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying news articles as either *real* or *fake*. Using a combination of text cleaning, feature extraction (such as TF-IDF vectorization and linguistic features), and classification algorithms, the project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for fake news detection.

## Problem Statement

With the proliferation of misinformation online, effective fake news detection systems are more critical than ever. This project seeks to:
- Automatically distinguish between genuine and fabricated news.
- Provide insights through data visualization and descriptive statistics.
- Offer a prototype model that can be improved and scaled for real-world applications.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes a collection of news articles labeled as "real" or "fake." The data comes from publicly available sources, and you can replace it with your own dataset if needed. Make sure to update the data path in the notebook accordingly.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration:**  
   - Load and summarize the dataset.
   - Visualize class distribution and text lengths.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Clean and normalize the text (e.g., lowercasing, punctuation removal).
   - Remove stop words and perform stemming/lemmatization using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
   - Extract additional features such as word counts and readability scores.

4. **Model Training:**  
   - Train several classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

5. **Evaluation & Visualization:**  
   - Plot confusion matrices, ROC curves, and compute metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
